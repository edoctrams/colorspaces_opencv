This mini project demonstrates how to work with multiple color spaces using OpenCV. It converts an input image into RGB, Grayscale, HSV, and LAB color spaces, and displays the result using matplotlib.

---

## Features

- Upload an image directly in Colab
- Convert and visualize:
  - RGB
  - Grayscale
  - HSV
  - LAB
- Uses OpenCV for processing and matplotlib for visualization

---

## How to Run

1. Run the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload an image when prompted
3. The notebook will show the image in 4 color models

## Requirements

- Python 3 (built-in with Colab)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
